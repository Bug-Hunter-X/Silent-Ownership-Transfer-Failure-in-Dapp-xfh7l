This repository demonstrates a common bug in DApps involving silent failure in ownership transfer. The `bug.sol` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.sol` provides a corrected version. The issue stems from the insufficient handling of invalid new owner addresses; the transaction does not revert upon encountering an invalid address, leading to unexpected and silent failure.
